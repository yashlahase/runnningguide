        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Key Tips</h1>
  
        <p>Always do a 5-minute warm-up before running (light walking or stretching) and a cool-down afterward.</p>
        <p>Start slow, listen to your body, and donâ€™t push too hard. Gradually increase the intensity.</p>
        <p>Drink plenty of water before and after your run. Fuel your body with healthy foods to support your running.</p>
        <p>Ensure you are getting enough rest and recovery to avoid injuries.</p>
